# Aim:
Design and analyze the differential amplifier for the following steps VDD=3.3v, P<=3mw, Vicm =1.72v,Vocm=1.81v,Vp=0.7v perform DC analysis,transient analysis,frequency response and extract the parameters.

Differential Amplifier:

A differential amplifier consists of two transistors, M1 and M2, with their source terminals connected together. When different voltage signals are applied to the gate terminals of these transistors, the current flowing through M1 and M2 varies accordingly. However, if the gate terminals receive identical voltage inputs, the currents through both transistors remain equal. This arrangement is known as a "Common-Mode Input Voltage Differential Amplifier." Regardless of the load resistor used, it is essential to ensure that MOSFETs M1 and M2 do not operate in the Triode region. For the amplifier to function correctly, both transistors must stay in the Saturation region.

Procedure : Make the circuit connection as given above. connect the resister at the source terminal of both mosfet now calculate the value of Iss as power and vdd is given and calculate the Id1 and Id2 now calculate the Rss and Rd

To find the all the values of resistor and current value. we need solve the given queston specification.
P=3mA

Iss=P/VDD=3*10^3/3.3=0.909mA

Is1=Is2=Iss/2=0.4545mA

RD=VDD-Vocm/Iss=3.3-1.7/0.45*10^3=3.55k立

Rss=Vp/Iss=0.5/0.909*10^3=0.555k立

Finially by solving we get

Iss=0.909mA

I1=I2=0.4545mA

RD=3.55k立

Rss=0.555k立

# INFERENCE:
In this experiment, we seen the working principles of a differential amplifier and its types and configuration.

There are three types of configurations were implemented: resistor , current source , and an NMOS . All the implements work on different ways that results into the cahnge in Voltage gain and stabillity of a mosfet.

when resistor is connected it provides low CMRR,deduce gain voltage,but high bandwidth and also provide negative feedback

But in the case of current source connection it is reciprocal of resistor connection because it has high gain volatge, high CMRR,but slight reduce in the bandwidth compared to the resistor connection.

Highest gain volltage is drewn by the circuit of CMOSN connection

By this we can say at what time/situation is required we can use that configuration.

1.Need more Band width-Use Resistor configuration

2.Need more Gain-Use CMOSN Configuration

3.Need precise CMRR-Use current or CMOSN configuration
